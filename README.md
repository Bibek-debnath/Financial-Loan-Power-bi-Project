# Financial-Loan-Power-bi-Project
Introduction

In today’s world, banks and financial companies give loans to people for many reasons such as buying a car, paying credit card bills, education, medical needs, or debt consolidation. Managing thousands of loans is not easy because companies must make sure that people repay their loans on time. If many customers fail to repay, the company may face heavy losses.

This project is based on financial loan data analysis, where I studied customer loan information to understand loan behavior, repayment status, risk factors, and trends. I used Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that clearly shows important loan insights. This project helps financial institutions take better decisions and reduce risk.

📌 Objective of the Project

The main aim of this project is to understand how loans are performing and to answer important business questions such as:

How many loans are fully paid and how many are charged off?

Which loan purpose has the highest loan amount?

Which loan term (36 months or 60 months) is safer?

How does customer income affect loan repayment?

In which months are loans taken the most?

By answering these questions, banks can improve loan approval policies and manage risks better.

📌 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about loan applicants and their loan status. Each row represents one loan record.

Some important columns in the dataset are:

Loan amount

Loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current)

Loan term (36 months or 60 months)

Purpose of loan

Annual income

Interest rate

Installment amount

Verification status

Employment length

This data helps in understanding both customer behavior and loan performance.

📌 Tools Used

To complete this project, I used the following tools:

Microsoft Excel for cleaning and formatting the data

MySQL for analyzing and querying the data

Power BI for creating dashboards and visualizations

GitHub for project documentation and sharing my work

📌 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard shows the complete picture of loan performance using charts, graphs, and KPIs. At the top of the dashboard, important values such as Total Loans, Total Loan Amount, Total Payment, and Total Annual Income are displayed.

Filters like Loan Status, Purpose, and Employee Length help users analyze specific data easily.

📌 Loan Status Analysis

One of the most important parts of this project is loan status analysis.

The dashboard shows that the majority of loans are Fully Paid, which means most customers are successfully repaying their loans. This is a positive sign for the company. A smaller portion of loans is Charged Off, which means customers failed to repay their loans and the company faced losses. Some loans are still Current, meaning they are active and repayment is ongoing.

This analysis helps banks understand how healthy their loan portfolio is.

📌 Loan Term Analysis

Loans are generally given for 36 months or 60 months.

From the dashboard, it is clear that 36-month loans contribute more to total installment payments compared to 60-month loans. Short-term loans are usually safer because customers repay them faster, reducing long-term risk.

This insight helps banks focus more on shorter-term loans to maintain financial stability.

📌 Monthly Loan Trend Analysis

The dashboard also shows loan amount by month.

It is observed that loan amounts gradually increase as the year progresses. The highest loan disbursement happens in the later months, especially around November and December. This may be due to festivals, year-end expenses, or personal financial needs.

This trend helps banks plan their funds and prepare for high loan demand during specific months.

📌 Loan Purpose Analysis

Different people take loans for different reasons.

The analysis shows that Debt Consolidation has the highest loan amount. This means many customers take loans to combine multiple debts into one. Credit card loans and car loans also form a large portion of total loans.

This information helps banks understand customer needs and design better loan products.

📌 Customer Income & Risk Analysis

Customer income plays a very important role in loan repayment.

From the analysis, customers with higher annual income are more likely to repay loans on time. Also, customers whose income is verified or source verified show better repayment behavior compared to non-verified customers.

This helps banks reduce risk by giving loans to reliable customers.

📌 Overall Insights

From this project, several important conclusions can be drawn:

Most loans are fully paid, showing a strong and healthy loan portfolio.

Short-term loans are safer and more profitable.

Debt consolidation is the most common loan purpose.

Income verification reduces the chances of loan default.

Loan demand increases during certain months of the year.

📌 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made:

Banks should focus more on 36-month loan plans.

Proper income verification should be made compulsory.

Extra attention should be given to customers with a high risk of default.

Loan campaigns can be planned during peak months.

Special products can be designed for debt consolidation customers.
