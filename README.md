# Financial-Loan-Power-bi-Project
Introduction

In today’s world, banks and financial companies give loans to people for many reasons such as buying a car, paying credit card bills, education, medical needs, or debt consolidation. Managing thousands of loans is not easy because companies must make sure that people repay their loans on time. If many customers fail to repay, the company may face heavy losses.

This project is based on financial loan data analysis, where I studied customer loan information to understand loan behavior, repayment status, risk factors, and trends. I used Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that clearly shows important loan insights. This project helps financial institutions take better decisions and reduce risk.

📌 Objective of the Project

The main aim of this project is to understand how loans are performing and to answer important business questions such as:

How many loans are fully paid and how many are charged off?

Which loan purpose has the highest loan amount?

Which loan term (36 months or 60 months) is safer?

How does customer income affect loan repayment?

In which months are loans taken the most?

By answering these questions, banks can improve loan approval policies and manage risks better.

📌 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about loan applicants and their loan status. Each row represents one loan record.

Some important columns in the dataset are:

Loan amount

Loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current)

Loan term (36 months or 60 months)

Purpose of loan

Annual income

Interest rate

Installment amount

Verification status

Employment length

This data helps in understanding both customer behavior and loan performance.

📌 Tools Used

To complete this project, I used the following tools:

Microsoft Excel for cleaning and formatting the data

MySQL for analyzing and querying the data

Power BI for creating dashboards and visualizations

GitHub for project documentation and sharing my work

📌 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard shows the complete picture of loan performance using charts, graphs, and KPIs. At the top of the dashboard, important values such as Total Loans, Total Loan Amount, Total Payment, and Total Annual Income are displayed.

Filters like Loan Status, Purpose, and Employee Length help users analyze specific data easily.

1) What is the overall performance of the loan portfolio?

✅ Key Insight:

The dashboard shows that the total loan amount is 436 million, out of which a large portion of loans are successfully repaid. This indicates that the loan portfolio is financially stable and well managed.

📘 Explanation:

A healthy loan portfolio means that most customers are paying their loans on time. This reduces losses for the financial institution and increases trust in its lending system. A high repayment rate also shows that loan approval policies are effective and customers are financially capable of repayment.

2️) What is the distribution of loans by loan status?

✅ Key Insight:

The donut chart shows that Fully Paid loans account for 80.63% (351M) of the total loan amount. Charged-off loans contribute 15.04% (66M), while the remaining portion consists of current loans that are still active.

📘 Explanation:

Most loans being fully paid is a positive sign for the company. Charged-off loans represent customers who failed to repay, which causes financial loss. Since charged-off loans are a smaller portion, it shows that the company has controlled credit risk well. Current loans must be monitored closely to ensure timely repayment.

3️) How do loan terms affect installment amounts?

✅ Key Insight:

Loans with a 36-month term contribute 70.37% (8.87M) of total installment payments, while 60-month loans contribute 29.63% (3.74M).

📘 Explanation:

Short-term loans require higher monthly payments but are repaid faster. This reduces long-term risk for the lender. Long-term loans have lower monthly installments but carry higher risk because customers must repay over a longer time period. This insight helps banks prefer shorter loan durations.

4️) How does loan amount change month by month?

✅ Key Insight:

The bar chart shows a steady increase in loan amount throughout the year, with the highest loan disbursement in December (54M) and the lowest in January and February (25M).

📘 Explanation:

This pattern suggests that customers take more loans towards the end of the year, possibly due to festivals, personal expenses, or year-end financial needs. Understanding this trend helps financial institutions plan funds, staff, and marketing activities during high-demand periods.

5️) What are the most common loan purposes?

✅ Key Insight:

Debt consolidation loans have the highest loan amount (232M), followed by credit card loans (59M) and car loans (10M).

📘 Explanation:

Many customers take loans to combine multiple debts into one, making repayment easier. Credit card loans show short-term borrowing behavior, while car loans indicate asset-based lending. This information helps banks design better loan products based on customer needs.

6️) How does income verification impact loan performance?

✅ Key Insight:

Loans with verified or source-verified income show better repayment behavior compared to non-verified income loans.

📘 Explanation:

Income verification ensures that customers have a stable income source. Verified customers are more reliable and have a lower chance of default. This highlights the importance of strict income verification during loan approval.

7️) What is the relationship between customer income and loan amount?

✅ Key Insight:

Customers with higher annual income tend to take larger loan amounts and show better repayment performance.

📘 Explanation:

Higher-income customers are financially more stable and can handle higher EMIs. This reduces risk for lenders and improves overall loan recovery.

8️) How does employment length affect loan repayment?

✅ Key Insight:

Customers with longer employment history show better loan repayment behavior compared to customers with short or unstable employment.

📘 Explanation:

Employment length reflects job stability. A stable job provides consistent income, making loan repayment easier. This insight helps banks give preference to customers with longer employment history.

9️)What is the impact of interest rate on loan behavior?

✅ Key Insight:

Loans with higher interest rates show a higher probability of being charged off.

📘 Explanation:

High interest rates increase monthly installments, making repayment difficult for customers. This insight helps banks balance interest rates to reduce default risk while maintaining profitability.

10) What does the dashboard reveal about overall customer risk?

✅ Key Insight:

Customers with unverified income, high interest rates, and longer loan terms represent higher credit risk.

📘 Explanation:

By combining multiple factors like income, loan term, and interest rate, the dashboard helps identify risky customers early. This allows banks to take preventive actions such as stricter approval or higher security.

From this project, several important conclusions can be drawn:

Most loans are fully paid, showing a strong and healthy loan portfolio.

Short-term loans are safer and more profitable.

Debt consolidation is the most common loan purpose.

Income verification reduces the chances of loan default.

Loan demand increases during certain months of the year.

📌 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made:

Banks should focus more on 36-month loan plans.

Proper income verification should be made compulsory.

Extra attention should be given to customers with a high risk of default.

Loan campaigns can be planned during peak months.

Special products can be designed for debt consolidation customers.
